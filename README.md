## Abstract
Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) converts time continuous physical signal to digital number. In simple words, ADC converts analog signals in to digital signals that can be used by electronic circuits. In this paper a 3-bit Flash ADC is designed and implemented using comparator circuit called Inverter Threshold Comparator (ITC). The Sample & Hold circuit for ADC is implemented using Transmission Gate Switch (TGS). The Priority encoder is implemented as a Digital Circuit and coded using Verilog. The design is implemented using e-sim tool and sky130pdk.

## Circuit Details
ADC has its applications in high-speed communication and signal processing systems. Therefore there is a need of low power, low area and low cost ADCâ€™s. Comparator and encoder are the basic building blocks of Flash ADC.Sampling circuit is very much necessary for the efficient functioning of ADC. 


### 1. Transmission Gate Switch
   Transmission Gate switch is designed for the following specifications
     - Input frequency <= 20 KHz
     - Vdd = 1V
     - Sampling frequency = 800 KHz


   Components Used:
     - sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8_lvt
     - sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8_lvt
     - sky130_fd_pr__cap_mim_m3_1
